# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

names = ["nome1", "nome2", "nome3"]

print("Hi " + names[0] + " you are the best!")
print("Hi " + names[1] + " you are the best!")
print("Hi " + names[2] + " you are the best!")
