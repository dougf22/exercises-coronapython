# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

brands = ["Yamaha", "Honda", "Chevrolet"]

print("I like " + brands[0] + " because they are nice")
print("I like " + brands[1] + " because they are good")
print("I like " + brands[2] + " because they are awesome")
